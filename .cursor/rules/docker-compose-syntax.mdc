# Docker Compose Syntax Rule

Always use `docker compose` (with a space) instead of `docker-compose` (with a hyphen).

## Correct Usage
- `docker compose build`
- `docker compose up -d`  
- `docker compose down`
- `docker compose logs`
- `docker compose exec service_name bash`

## Incorrect Usage
- ❌ `docker-compose build`
- ❌ `docker-compose up -d`
- ❌ `docker-compose down`

This follows Docker Compose V2 standards where the compose functionality is integrated as a Docker CLI plugin rather than a separate binary.
